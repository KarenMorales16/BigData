## Scala | Variances
<div align="justify"> Variance is a measure of dispersion that represents the variability of a series of data with respect to its environment.Returns the unbiased variance of the values in a group. Variance is the interconnection of Sub-Typing relationships which are either of complicated types or of their constituent types. Variance explains inheritance correlation of Types that have parameters or arguments within them. These types belongs to the generic classes, which takes a type like a parameter. In the presence of Variance one can create relations between complicated types and in its absence we wonâ€™t be able to reiterate the abstraction class.</div>


```scala
df.select(variance("Sales")).show()
```
