## Vectoreassembler

VectorAssembler is a transformer that combines a given list of columns into a single vector column. It is useful for combining raw features and features generated by different feature transformers into a single feature vector, in order to train ML models like logistic regression and decision trees. VectorAssembler accepts the following input column types: all numeric types, boolean type, and vector type. In each row, the values of the input columns will be concatenated into a vector in the specified order.

**Examples**

Assume that we have a DataFrame with the columns id, hour, mobile, userFeatures, and clicked:
 id | hour | mobile | userFeatures     | clicked
----|------|--------|------------------|---------
 0  | 18   | 1.0    | [0.0, 10.0, 0.5] | 1.0

 userFeatures is a vector column that contains three user features. We want to combine hour, mobile, and userFeatures into a single feature vector called features and use it to predict clicked or not. If we set VectorAssemblerâ€™s input columns to hour, mobile, and userFeatures and output column to features, after transformation we should get the following DataFrame:

 id | hour | mobile | userFeatures     | clicked | features
----|------|--------|------------------|---------|-----------------------------
 0  | 18   | 1.0    | [0.0, 10.0, 0.5] | 1.0     | [18.0, 1.0, 0.0, 10.0, 0.5]



## Vectors

A local vector has integer-typed and 0-based indices and double-typed values, stored on a single machine. MLlib supports two types of local vectors: dense and sparse. A dense vector is backed by a double array representing its entry values, while a sparse vector is backed by two parallel arrays: indices and values. For example, a vector (1.0, 0.0, 3.0) can be represented in dense format as [1.0, 0.0, 3.0] or in sparse format as (3, [0, 2], [1.0, 3.0]), where 3 is the size of the vector.

The base class of local vectors is Vector, and we provide two implementations: DenseVector and SparseVector. We recommend using the factory methods implemented in Vectors to create local vectors.

Refer to the Vector Scala docs and Vectors Scala docs for details on the API.

```scala
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{Vector, Vectors}

// Create a dense vector (1.0, 0.0, 3.0).
val dv: Vector = Vectors.dense(1.0, 0.0, 3.0)
// Create a sparse vector (1.0, 0.0, 3.0) by specifying its indices and values corresponding to nonzero entries.
val sv1: Vector = Vectors.sparse(3, Array(0, 2), Array(1.0, 3.0))
// Create a sparse vector (1.0, 0.0, 3.0) by specifying its nonzero entries.
val sv2: Vector = Vectors.sparse(3, Seq((0, 1.0), (2, 3.0)))
```

## Root Means Squear Error

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; RMSE is a measure of how spread out these residuals are. In other words, it tells you how concentrated the data is around the line of best fit. Root mean square error is commonly used in climatology, forecasting, and regression analysis to verify experimental results.
